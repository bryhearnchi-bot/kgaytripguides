### Tables Removed from Database
The following tables were removed as they no longer exist in the database:
- `passwordResetTokens`
- `media`
- `parties`
- `partyTemplates`
- `eventTalent`

### Files Deleted
- `/server/storage/PartyStorage.ts` - Storage class for parties table (removed)
- `/server/storage/EventTalentStorage.ts` - Storage class for eventTalent table (removed)

### Files Modified

#### `/server/storage.ts`

- Removed `parties` table export
- Removed `eventTalent` table export
- Removed `MediaStorage` class and interface
- Removed `mediaStorage` instance export
- Removed `partyStorage` export
- Removed `eventTalentStorage` export

#### `/server/routes/media.ts`
- Removed `mediaStorage` import
- Removed all media-related API endpoints:
  - GET `/api/media`
  - GET `/api/media/type/:type`
  - GET `/api/media/:associatedType/:associatedId`
  - POST `/api/media`
  - PUT `/api/media/:id`
  - DELETE `/api/media/:id`

#### `/server/routes/locations.ts`

  - POST `/api/party-templates`
  - PUT `/api/party-templates/:id`
  - DELETE `/api/party-templates/:id`

#### `/server/routes/public.ts`
- No changes needed (settings endpoints kept as settings table exists)

#### `/server/auth-routes.ts`
- No changes needed (already fully commented out, passwordResetTokens references disabled)

#### `/server/production-seed.ts`
- No changes needed (only references existing tables)

#### `/tests/storage/storage-layer.test.ts`
- Removed imports for `Party` and `EventTalent` types
- Removed imports for `PartyStorage` and `EventTalentStorage`
- Skipped tests for removed storage classes with `.skip()`

### Verification
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ API endpoints work (tested `/api/ports`)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors related to cleanup
- ✅ Database connections work properly

### Notes
- The settings table and endpoints were kept as they exist in the current database
- All test files referencing removed storage classes have been updated to skip those tests
- The cleanup focused only on removing references to deleted tables without affecting existing functionality
