# Schema Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made to `shared/schema.ts`

### ✅ Fixed Field Names
1. **tripInfoSections table**:
   - Changed `cruiseId` → `tripId` for consistency
   - Fixed index references to use `tripId`

2. **invitations table**:
   - Changed `cruiseId` → `tripId` for consistency
   - Updated comment to "Optional trip-specific invitation"

### 🗑️ Removed Unused Tables
The following tables were removed from schema.ts as they were not created in the database:

1. **passwordResetTokens** - Can be implemented later when password reset feature is built
2. **settings** - Can be added when configuration management is needed
3. **media** - Currently using Supabase Storage directly
4. **parties** - Deprecated table replaced by party_themes
5. **partyTemplates** - Redundant with party_themes table

### 🔧 Cleaned Up Relations & Exports
Removed all related code for the deleted tables:
- Removed relation definitions
- Removed insert schemas
- Removed type exports
- Cleaned up imports

## Result
- **No TypeScript errors** in schema.ts
- **Schema matches database** structure exactly
- **Cleaner codebase** without unused definitions
- **Ready for frontend development**

## Next Steps
When you need these features in the future:
1. **Password Reset**: Create `passwordResetTokens` table when implementing password reset
2. **Settings Management**: Create `settings` table when building admin configuration
3. **Media Management**: Create `media` table if centralized asset management is needed

The schema is now clean, consistent, and production-ready!
