## üìù Implementation Notes

### Date & Time Handling

- **CRITICAL**: All dates/times are in LOCAL timezone (destination timezone)
- **NO timezone conversions** per CLAUDE.md Rule #1
- Store dates as: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., "2025-10-25")
- Store times as: `HH:MM` in 24-hour format (e.g., "17:00" for 5 PM)

### Foreign Key Dependencies

- Events MUST reference valid `ship_venue_id` from Step 2
- Events MUST reference valid `talent_ids` from Step 3
- Events MUST reference valid `event_type_id` (already exists in DB)
- Events MAY reference `party_theme_id` (already assigned to trip)

### Talent IDs in Events

- Store as JSONB array: `[talent_id1, talent_id2, ...]`
- Empty array `[]` for events without specific talent (parties, orientation, etc.)
- Single talent: `[talent_id]`
- Multiple talent: `[talent_id1, talent_id2, talent_id3]`

### Image Storage

- Per CLAUDE.md Rule #5: ALL images must be in Supabase storage
- No external image URLs allowed
- If adding images later, download and upload to Supabase first

### Validation Checklist

Before executing:

- [ ] Verify ship_id 12 exists for Brilliant Lady
- [ ] Verify all venue_type_ids exist (1=Restaurant, 2=Entertainment, 7=Casual Dining)
- [ ] Verify all talent_category_ids exist (2=Vocalists, 3=Drag, 5=Cabaret, 6=Comedy, 7=Shows)
- [ ] Verify all event_type_ids exist (1=party, 2=show, 3=dining, 4=lounge, 5=fun, 7=after, 8=social)
- [ ] Get party_theme_ids for: Dog Tag T-Dance, Washed Up, Twisted Pink, Neon Playground, Ghostly White, Thriller, Hallow-weird
