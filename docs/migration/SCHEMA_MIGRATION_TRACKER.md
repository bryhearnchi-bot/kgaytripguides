## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (Any Phase):
```bash
git reset --hard [commit-before-phase]
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Database Rollback:
Not needed - database schema is already correct

### API Compatibility Mode:
Keep redirect routes active until all clients updated

---

## 📝 Notes & Issues

### Known Issues:
- [x] Issue: Database health check failing | Solution: Expected due to schema mismatch, will be fixed in Phase 1

### Discoveries During Phase 2:
- **Generation Script Missing**: api:generate-types script referenced in package.json doesn't exist
- **Manual Updates Needed**: Updated api-types-generated.ts manually to align with new schema
- **Type Conflicts**: Fixed duplicate export declarations in api-types.ts
- **Backward Compatibility**: CruiseStorage class in storage.ts updated to use Trip types
- **Import Updates**: Fixed User→Profile import in auth.ts
- **Successful Alignment**: All major type references updated (Event.tripId, Location, Profile)

### Discoveries During Phase 0:
- **Endpoint Analysis**: Found 120 total endpoints - 65% using new schema, 26% legacy/mixed, 9% neutral
- **Critical Finding**: Both `/api/cruises` and `/api/trips` endpoints exist simultaneously causing confusion
- **Storage Issue**: Static file paths still using old bucket structure (`/cruise-images`, `/port-images`, etc.)
- **Database Confirmed**: Supabase database correctly uses new schema (trips, locations, profiles tables verified)
- **Test Environment**: Dev server starts but database health fails (expected until Phase 1 complete)

### Team Notes:
- Solo project - no team coordination needed
- Using Supabase automatic backups for database
- All changes tracked in Git for rollback capability
