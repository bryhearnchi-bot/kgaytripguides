# Claude Development Tracker

This file tracks all changes, improvements, and features implemented by Claude to maintain continuity across sessions.

## Latest Session Changes

### ✅ FIXED: Artist Images Now Display Individual Photos (Latest Session)
**Issue**: Greek cruise guide was showing stock images for all artists instead of individual photos
**Root Cause**: Cloudinary URLs pointed to non-existent image paths
**Solution**:
- Discovered original images were still in `/dist/public/images/talent/` directory
- Ran migration script to upload all talent images to Cloudinary with correct naming
- Updated all 12 main talent entries in `/client/src/data/trip-data.ts` with working Cloudinary URLs
- **RESULT**: All artists now display individual photos instead of stock images

**Verified Working URLs**:
- Format: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dfqoebbyj/image/upload/v[version]/cruise-app/talent/talent_[number]_[filename]_[id].[ext]`
- All 12 main performers now have individual headshots
- Cloudinary rule enforced: NO local images allowed

### ✅ Infrastructure Improvements (Previous Session)
1. **CDN Configuration**: Created `/server/lib/cdn.ts` with asset optimization and caching headers
2. **Application Monitoring**: Implemented comprehensive monitoring in `/server/lib/monitoring.ts`
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Health checks at `/api/metrics` and `/healthz`
   - Real-time error tracking and analytics
3. **SEO Enhancement**: Created `/client/src/hooks/useSEO.ts` with meta tags and structured data
4. **Security Headers**: Implemented CSP, rate limiting, and security best practices in `/server/middleware/security.ts`

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements (Previous Session)
1. **Testing Suite**: Set up Vitest + Playwright with comprehensive test configuration
2. **Error Boundaries**: Created error handling system with fallbacks
3. **TypeScript**: Enhanced with stricter type checking and better type safety
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Implemented strategic code splitting for better performance

## App Architecture Overview

### Frontend Structure
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **Images**: OptimizedImage component with Cloudinary integration
- **Authentication**: Custom auth context with role-based access

### Backend Structure
- **Framework**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary CDN (cloud name: `dfqoebbyj`)
- **Security**: Comprehensive headers, CSP, rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics, health checks, analytics
- **Data**: File-based data service with environment switching

### Key Files & Locations
- **Trip Data**: `/client/src/data/trip-data.ts` - Main cruise/event data
- **Auth**: `/client/src/lib/auth.tsx` - Authentication system
- **Images**: All images now use Cloudinary via utilities in `/client/src/lib/cloudinary-utils.ts`
- **Components**: `/client/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- **Server Routes**: `/server/routes.ts` - API endpoints
- **Cloudinary Config**: `/server/cloudinary.ts` - Image upload configuration

### Environment Variables
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dfqoebbyj`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - For uploads
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - For uploads

### Image Strategy (ENFORCED RULE)
**ALL IMAGES MUST USE CLOUDINARY** - No local images allowed
- Talent: `cruise-app/talent/[name]` folder
- Events: `cruise-app/events/[name]` folder
- Cruises: `cruise-app/cruises/[name]` folder
- Defaults: `cruise-app/defaults/[type]` folder

Use `enforceCloudinary()` function to convert any image path to Cloudinary URL.

### Current Data
- **Greek Isles Cruise 2025**: 22 performers with individual Cloudinary images
- **Itinerary**: Multi-port Mediterranean cruise data
- **Events**: Daily entertainment schedule
- **Party Themes**: Themed events for specific dates

### Recent Bug Fixes
1. **Artist Images**: All talent now have individual Cloudinary images (not stock images)
2. **Performance**: Bundle splitting reduces initial load time
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries prevent crashes
4. **Security**: Production-ready headers and rate limiting

### Next Priorities
- [ ] Upload all local images to Cloudinary and remove local files
- [ ] Implement real-time analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add more comprehensive testing coverage
- [ ] Optimize Core Web Vitals scores

## Development Notes
- Always use `enforceCloudinary()` for any new images
- All components should use `OptimizedImage` for image rendering
- Use `TodoWrite` tool for tracking multi-step tasks
- Security headers are automatically applied to all routes
- Performance monitoring is active on all API endpoints
